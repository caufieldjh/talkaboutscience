# talkaboutscience
A simple Twitter bot for posting things that sound like science, but in most cases are not.

Check it out at [@talk_about_sci](https://twitter.com/talk_about_sci).

The code is appropriate for assembling your own silly Twitter bot.
Please note that [you'll need to generate consumer access tokens first](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens).

If you're just looking for a long list of technical terminology from various fields, check out *sciencewords.txt*. It's a tab-delimited file of one word or phrase per line, followed by whether it's an adjective or noun. Some may be both, or at least may be used as either.

### Future additions
I would love to present these as mockup scientific literature headlines.
That's a quick project for a rainy day.
